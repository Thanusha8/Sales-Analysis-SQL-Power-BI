## üìä Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow for a pizza sales dataset. The core objectives were to:
1.  Use **SQL** to calculate crucial Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and extract meaningful trends.
2.  Develop an interactive **Power BI** dashboard to visualize these insights effectively.
3.  Validate the accuracy of Power BI visualizations by cross-referencing them with the output of SQL queries.

The analysis answers business questions about revenue, order trends, best-selling products, and customer preferences.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **SQL:** For data extraction, transformation, and calculation of KPIs.
*   **Microsoft Power BI:** For building the interactive dashboard and visualizations.
*   **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Likely used within Power BI for calculated measures.


## üìà Key Insights & Analysis

The project focuses on two main areas:

### A. SQL Calculation
SQL queries calculated the main numbers first to ensure accuracy:
*   **Total Revenue:** 
*   **Average Order Value:** 
*   **Total Pizzas Sold:** 
*   **Total Orders:** 
*   **Average Pizzas Per Order:**
*   **Daily Trend for Total Orders:** 
*   **Monthly Trend for Total Orders:** 
*   **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category:** 
*   **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size:** 
*   **Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category:**
*   **Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders** 
*   **Bottom 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders** 


### B. Power BI Visualization
The SQL outputs were used to build and validate the following charts in the Power BI dashboard:
*   **Total Revenue:** 
*   **Average Order Value:** 
*   **Total Pizzas Sold:** 
*   **Total Orders:** 
*   **Average Pizzas Per Order:**
*   **Daily Trend for Total Orders:** 
*   **Monthly Trend for Total Orders:** 
*   **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Category:** 
*   **Percentage of Sales by Pizza Size:** 
*   **Total Pizzas Sold by Pizza Category:**
*   **Top 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders** 
*   **Bottom 5 Best Sellers by Revenue, Total Quantity and Total Orders** 


## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   A SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server) to run the `.sql` file.
*   Microsoft Power BI Desktop (free) to open and explore the `.pbix` file.



## üìã Key Learning Outcomes
*   **SQL Proficiency:** Writing complex queries for aggregation, grouping, and trend analysis.
*   **Data Validation:** Ensuring accuracy by using SQL as a benchmark for BI tool calculations.
*   **BI Dashboard Design:** Translating business requirements into effective and interactive visualizations.
*   **End-to-End Workflow:** Managing a complete data analysis project from raw data to a published dashboard.
